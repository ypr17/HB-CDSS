The access link for Hepatitis B CDSS is: http://101.6.68.113:8501/.

It currently provides functionalities for disease reasoning and recommended reference cases. 
The disease reasoning function is based on the large-scale medical knowledge graph _LMKG_.
The corresponding paper is _LMKG: A Large-Scale and Multi-Source Medical Knowledge Graph for Intelligent Medicine Applications_.
